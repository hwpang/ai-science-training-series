# Homework
What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it? Your answer does not need to be in paragraphs. When you submit your homework form, you can link to a file in your Github repo where you wrote your answer.

I think LLMs can aid science in terms of literature search and summarization, although it requires the user to double check the literature source to make sure the information are correct. LLMs can also help science in terms of mundane tasks, like coming up with symbols to be used in the equations, or helping to make LinkedIn posts to advertise one's new publication. For these tasks, there is less at stake in terms of correctness and can help save time for scientists from inevitable but boring tasks.
